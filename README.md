## Dependencies
Depending on the module you are going to use it will need some dependencies to work as expected.\
The Kotlin module was developed using [Fuel](https://github.com/kittinunf/fuel), it has native support for [`kotlinx.coroutines`](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) so you can use them.
